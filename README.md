- Blog Post: https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html
- Web Demo: https://crfm.stanford.edu/alpaca/

The repo contains:

- The [52K data](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model.
- The code for [generating the data](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#data-generation-process).
- The code for [fine-tuning the model](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca#fine-tuning).

![Stanford-Alpaca](./assets/logo.png)

The current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section. In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].

## Alpaca model fine-tuned for application

A series of fine-tuned models derived from the Alpaca model. Some of them have publicly available weights, are fine-tuned for specific domains, and have better performance. These types of models are still being continuously developed.

### Alpaca-LoRA: Low-Rank LLaMA Instruct-Tuning

Contains:  `Dataset`, `Data Genrating Code`, `Finetune Code`, `Model Weight`, `LoRA`

- Github Page: https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora
- Discord Community: [here](https://discord.gg/prbq284xX5)
- Model: **[here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tloen/alpaca-lora)**

This repository contains code for reproducing the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) results using [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf). Alpaca-LoRA provide an Instruct model of similar quality to `text-davinci-003` that can run [on a Raspberry Pi](https://twitter.com/miolini/status/1634982361757790209) (for research), and the code is easily extended to the `13b`, `30b`, and `65b` models.

In addition to the training code, which runs within five hours on a single RTX 4090, Alpaca-LoRA publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA, as well as the resulting [LoRA weights themselves](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main). To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, Alpaca-LoRA use Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).

Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model.

To promote open research of large models in the Chinese NLP community, this project has open-sourced the **Chinese LLaMA model and the Alpaca large model with instruction fine-tuning**. These models expand the Chinese vocabulary based on the original LLaMA and use Chinese data for secondary pre-training, further enhancing Chinese basic semantic understanding. Additionally, the project uses Chinese instruction data for fine-tuning on the basis of the Chinese LLaMA, significantly improving the model's understanding and execution of instructions.

## Some Large Language Models

Large language models provide powerful foundational capabilities for generative models and are also the basis for model fine-tuning. It is difficult to define what scale of language model can be considered a large language model, as the size of the model's parameters is related to the industry's hardware level (computing power). The scale of large models continues to evolve, and definitions are changing. In addition to OpenAI's GPT series available through an interface, this article lists some other excellent downloadable model weights for commonly used large language models.

Compared to the relatively closed usage of OpenAI's model, fine-tuning this type of language model is also a good choice.

## Some Resources for Instruction Fine-tuning.

### 🗂️ LlamaIndex 🦙 (GPT Index)

LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It provides the following tools in an easy-to-use fashion:

- Offers **data connectors** to your existing data sources and data formats (API's, PDF's, docs, SQL, etc.)
- Provides indices over your unstructured and structured data for use with LLM's. These indices help to abstract away common boilerplate and pain points for in-context learning:
  - Storing context in an easy-to-access format for prompt insertion.
  - Dealing with prompt limitations (e.g. 4096 tokens for Davinci) when context is too big.
  - Dealing with text splitting.
- Provides users an interface to **query** the index (feed in an input prompt) and obtain a knowledge-augmented output.
- Offers you a comprehensive toolset trading off cost and performance
